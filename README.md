# Bible Books & Divisions Explorer

An interactive single-page site designed to help with easy exploration of the books of the Bible, including canonical and apocryphal texts, as well as a section on Christian sacraments. This project serves as an educational tool and should not in any way be considered as a definitive statement on behalf of any denomination, organization or institution. 

## Features

- **Interactive Tabs:** Easily switch between the **Old Testament**, **New Testament**, and **Apocrypha** to explore their respective books.
  
- **Book Details:** Click on any book to view a short description of its contents.
  
- **Filtering:** Filter books and videos by genre or category for a more focused experience (some of the filtering is a bit unnecessary in places… sorry).
  
- **Data Visualization:** A dynamic doughnut chart visually represents the distribution of books across different genres within each testament. It’s a bit wonky, but I struggled to get it to look quite right, so… it is what it is.
  
- **Videos:** There’s a section with embedded videos to provide an overview of the Bible's history and literary styles. The videos come from the Bible Project on YouTube, but they’re not in any way affiliated with this site or project. I just liked their overview videos - they’re very informative and visually cool.
  
- **Sacraments Section:** An quick look at Christian sacraments, including their different interpretations across various denominations.
  
- **Responsive Design:** The layout should be responsive, but I’ve not tested it on mobile so… I hope it works!
  

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5:** Provides the core structure.
  
- **Tailwind CSS:** Used for styling.
  
- **Chart.js:** Powers the distribution doughnut thingy.
  
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** Handles the application logic (obviously).
  

## How to Use

Just open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can navigate the different sections using the tabs and sub-tabs at the top of the page.

- Click on the **Bible** or **Sacraments** tabs to switch between the two main sections.
  
- Within the Bible section, use the sub-tabs to view the **Old Testament**, **New Testament**, or **Apocrypha**.
  
- Select a book card to see its description.
  
- In the Sacraments section, choose a sacrament sub-tab to read its details and use the denomination filters to see different interpretations.
